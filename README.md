# SwiftlyHybrid
A straightforward yet powerful Hybrid development platform for iOS and OS X. SwiftlyHybrid provides you with what you need to develop installable apps in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 without being difficult and using large amounts of RAM and CPU time. If you are working cross-platform, AndyHybrid is the Android version.

Other libraries, such as appache cordova/phoneGap, are bloated. They include old code required to support much older environments. The vast majority of Hybrid development projects don't need those complicated, large libraries. SwiftlyHybrid, and its Android twin AndyHybrid, are more than sufficient.
